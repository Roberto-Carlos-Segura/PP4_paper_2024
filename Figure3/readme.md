### README FIG3
This directory contains the data and code for the figures and statistical tests shown in figure 3.

## There are two files in this directory:
- `FIG3.ipynb`, the Jupyter Python notebook used to visualize the data and perform statistical tests.
- The python notebook is further annotated with markdown explaining the purpose of the code, rationale behind statistical tests, and origin of the data/experiments.
- `Fig3 metadata.xlsx`, which is an excel spreadsheet used to organize the data. 
	- Within this spreadsheet, the data is organized into sheets based on what figure the data corresponds with.
	- This data was manually copied over from the python notebooks for ease of submission.  

## There are three sub-directories in this directory:
- `data`, which contains the excel and csv files called by the python notebook.
- `figs`, which can be used to save figure outputs to if desired. 
	- to do this, adjust the code in `FIG3.ipynb` to un-comment the lines of code that save the figures.  
- `output`, which is where the statistic tables are saved by the python notebooks.
