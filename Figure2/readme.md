### README FIG2
This directory contains the data and code for the figures and statistical tests shown in figure 2.

## There are two files in this directory:
- `FIG2.ipynb`, the Jupyter Python notebook used to visualize the data and perform statistical tests.
- The python notebook is further annotated with markdown explaining the purpose of the code, rationale behind statistical tests, and origin of the data/experiments.
- `Fig2 metadata.xlsx`, which is an excel spreadsheet used to organize the data. 
	- Within this spreadsheet, the data is organized into sheets based on what figure the data corresponds with. I.e., the sheet labeled "measurements Fig 1C, 1D, 1F, 1H" contains the data used in figures 1C, 1D, 1F, and 1H.
	- The last sheet is titled `STATS` and contains the stats tables generated by the python notebooks.
	- This data was manually copied over from the python notebooks for ease of submission.  

## There are three sub-directories in this directory:
- `data`, which contains the excel and csv files called by the python notebook.
	- This contains both the data used for the line plot measurements in Figure 2A, B, D, and E, and the intensity data used in 2C and F. 
- `figs`, which can be used to save figure outputs to if desired. 
	- to do this, adjust the code in `FIG2.ipynb` to un-comment the lines of code that save the figures.  
- `output`, which is where the statistic tables are saved by the python notebooks.
