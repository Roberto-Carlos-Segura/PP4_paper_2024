### README SuppFig3
This directory contains the data and code for the figures and statistical tests shown in supplemental figure 3.

## There are two files in this directory:
- `SuppFig3.ipynb`, the Jupyter Python notebook used to visualize the data and perform statistical tests.
- The python notebook is further annotated with markdown explaining the purpose of the code, rationale behind statistical tests, and origin of the data/experiments.
- `SuppFig3 data.xlsx`, which is an excel spreadsheet used to organize the data. 
	- The data is organized by what figure it corresponds with.
	- The data is compromised of manual count annotations of the frequency of either 1X (WT), 2X (gain-of-function), or 0X (loss of function) MTOC activity in the different gamma tubulin mutants. 
	- These counts were then normalized to be represented as a percent and used for plotting in the jupyter notebook.  
- Visualization was done using the `seaborn` library.
