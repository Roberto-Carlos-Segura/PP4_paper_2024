### README FIG4
This directory contains the data and code for the figures and statistical tests shown in figure 4.

## There are two files in this directory:
- `FIG4.ipynb`, the Jupyter Python notebook used to visualize the data and perform statistical tests.
- The python notebook is further annotated with markdown explaining the purpose of the code, rationale behind statistical tests, and origin of the data/experiments.
- `Fig4 data.xlsx`, which is an excel spreadsheet used to organize the data. 
	- The tab titled `Figure 4F, G` contains the raw and calculated values for microtubule intensity. 
	- This tab has the data after background subtraction as previously defined, and the data in the columns titled `AC/Cyto`, `BC/Cyto`, and `AC/BC` is what is plotted by the jupyter notebook.
		- Visualization was done using the `seaborn` library. 
		- statistical tests were chosen based on compatibility with the data: if the data was normally distributed, an unpaired student's t-test was used. If the data was non-parametric, a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test was used. a p value of 0.05 was used to determine significance. 
- The last sheet is titled `STATS` and contains the stats tables generated by the python notebooks.
